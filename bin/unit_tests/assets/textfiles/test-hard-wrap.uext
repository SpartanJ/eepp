```go
func fmt.Errorf(format string, a ...any) error
```

---

Errorf formats according to a format specifier and returns the string as a value that satisfies error.

If the format specifier includes a %w verb with an error operand, the returned error will implement an Unwrap method returning the operand. If there is more than one %w verb, the returned error will implement an Unwrap method returning a \[]error containing all the %w operands in the order they appear in the arguments. It is invalid to supply the %w verb with an operand that does not implement the error interface. The %w verb is otherwise a synonym for %v.
